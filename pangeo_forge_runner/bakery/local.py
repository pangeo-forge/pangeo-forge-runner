        in_memory: Runner and workersâ€™ communication happens in memory (not through gRPC). This is a default mode.
        multi_threading: Runner and workers communicate through gRPC and each worker runs in a thread.
        multi_processing: Runner and workers communicate through gRPC and each worker runs in a subprocess.

        multi_processing is closest to most production runners, as it enables real usage of multiple
        CPUs on the host machine. **However**, it can mess up logging, so is not the default here.
